# Coffee Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis of global coffee sales using Microsoft Excel. The dataset spans multiple tables such as orders, customers, and products. I created an interactive dashboard that enables dynamic exploration of key sales insights.

 ## Key Steps & Features:

### Data Preparation & Transformation:

Created a Total Sales column by multiplying unit price and quantity.

Added readable Roast Type Name (e.g., Medium, Light, Dark) using Excelâ€™s logical functions.

Mapped short coffee type codes (e.g., "Rob") to full names (e.g., "Robusta") using formulas.

Used VLOOKUP to bring in loyalty card information from the customer table.

### Data Modeling & Relationships:

Combined multiple tables (orders, customers, products) to create a unified dataset for analysis.

### Analysis & Dashboarding:

Built pivot tables to analyze total sales by coffee type, country, and time.

Visualized sales trends over time using a line graph with multiple lines for different coffee types.

Designed an interactive dashboard using slicers for roast type, coffee size, loyalty card status, and timeline filtering.

### Visual Elements:
Bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, slicers, and timeline filters for user-driven insights.

## Tools Used: 
Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, IF Formulas, Line & Bar Charts, Slicers, Hyperlinked Navigation
## Sheets Included: 
orders, customers, products, SalesByCountry, TotalSales, Dashboard, and more.
